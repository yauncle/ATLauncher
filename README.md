## Coding Standards & Styling Guidelines

Please see the [STYLE.md](STYLE.md) file for coding standards and style guidelines.

## Contributing to ATLauncher

Take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Testing

Please see the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for information on how we write tests.

## Building

To build this project, simply run:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

This will build the application and output the resulting files for Windows, Linux and OSX in the
`dist` directory.

## Running in test

If you want to run the launcher while developing with it, you can use your IDE (if you have one) to
do that for you.

Alternatively you can run:

```sh
./gradlew run --args="--debug --debug-level 3 --working-dir=test"
```

## Using VSCode

This project is setup to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. You're free
to use any other IDE that you're accustomed to (if any), but by using VSCode, you get the benefit
of predefined tasks and launch commands.

## Checking for dependency updates

To check for dependency updates with gradle, simply run:

```sh
./gradlew dependencyUpdates
```

This will print a report to the console about any dependencies which have updates.

## Plugging In Your Data

To get started with the code and plug in your own data, you need to edit the
/src/main/java/com/atlauncher/data/Constants.java file.

By using this source code you don't get permissions to use our CDN/files/assets/modpacks. See the
License section at the bottom for more.

See below for explanations as to what each constant means.

### VERSION

This is a LauncherVersion object passed in the reserved, major, minor, revision ints for this
version of the launcher. See the 'Versioning System' section below.

### API_BASE_URL

This is a link to your server side API for processing of leaderboard times and pack installs. This
is optional and can be removed. We do not give implementation code, this is your own doing.

### PASTE_CHECK_URL

This is a link to the url where an instance of [stikked](https://github.com/claudehohl/Stikked) is
running (For instance http://www.mypaste.com) this is how the launcher knows if the paste was
successful by checking the response from the API for the url of the software.

_Please note that the domain given above IS NOT REAL. You must install
[stikked](https://github.com/claudehohl/Stikked) on your own domain and reference it, the domain is
only there as an example of what a valid value is._

### PASTE_API_URL

Same as above

### SERVERS

This is an array of
[Server](https://github.com/ATLauncher/ATLauncher/blob/master/src/main/java/com/atlauncher/data/Server.java)
type elements the launcher uses as a base to download files.

### LAUNCHER_NAME

This is the name of the launcher.

### How to make your data

To make the data the Launcher needs you will need to figure out your own server side way of doing
that. You can create a system to do it automatically or you can manually do it by just popping the
files on the server. The best way to get the file structure and contents is to examine the source
code and the ATLauncher files it downloads.

## Versioning System

Starting with version 3.2.1.0 a new versioning system was put into place. It works off the
following:

Reserved.Major.Minor.Revision.Build

So for 3.2.1.0.0 the major number is 2 and minor number is 1 and revision number is 0. Reserved is
used as a base, only incremented on complete rewrites. The build number is optional and should be 0
on releases.

Major should be incremented when large changes/features are made.

Minor should be incremented when small changes/features are made.

Revision should be incremented when there are no new features and only contains bug fixes for the
previous minor.

Build is used for beta releases allowing you to have higher version numbers but force users to
update when the real
release comes.

## Translating

ATLauncher is written for English speakers. All our translations are community run by those who
take their time and submit updates to the text in a different language.

If you wish to help translate ATLauncher, please visit our page on
[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/atlauncher) and start translating.

### Updating the template file

If new strings are added to the launcher, the template file will need to be updated in order to
take into account the new strings.

In order to do this, run `./gradlew generatePots` which will scan the source files and create a
`build/gettext/translations.pot` file.

Note that out of the box, this will not generate in the correct format. The file should be opened
with [POEdit](https://poedit.net/), which will automatically fix the file, which then you can save
to `translations.pot` in the root directory, which will then get picked up by Crowdin.

## License

visit <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>.

A simple way to keep in terms of the license is by forking this repository and leaving it open
source under the same license. We love free software, seeing people use our code and then not share
the code, breaking the license, is saddening. So please take a look at the license and respect what
we're doing.

Also, while we cannot enforce this under the license, you cannot use our CDN/files/assets/modpacks
on your own launcher. Again we cannot enforce this under the license, but needless to say, we'd be
very unhappy if you did that and really would like to leave cease and desist letters as a last
resort.

If you have any questions or concerns as to the license or what we consider to be good and bad in
your clone/fork, please use the contact link in the section right above this one.
